#
# Best practices for Spot workloads:
# 1. Design for interruptions (2-minute warning)
# 2. Use multiple replicas for high availability
# 3. Implement graceful shutdown handlers
# 4. Use persistent storage for state
# 5. Set appropriate PodDisruptionBudgets
#
# Ideal workloads for Spot:
# - Stateless web applications
# - Batch processing jobs
# - CI/CD workers
# - Data processing pipelines
# - Development/staging environments
# - Queue workers
# - Containerized microservices
#
# Cost savings:
# - Up to 90% vs on-demand pricing
# - Graviton instances add additional 20-40% savings
# - Combined: up to 92-94% total savings possible
